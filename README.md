# SwiftShip

[![validate](https://github.com/rshankras/SwiftShip/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rshankras/SwiftShip/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

**Spec-driven development for iOS & macOS apps, run entirely through [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).**

Every change is checked in CI: all 190+ skill references resolve against the [skills library](https://github.com/rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills), documented counts match reality, every command is registered, and frontmatter is well-formed (`scripts/validate.sh`).

SwiftShip combines [GSD's workflow methodology](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core) with deep Apple-platform expertise to walk you from *"I have an app idea"* all the way to *"it's live on the App Store"* — without losing context between sessions.

## What is SwiftShip?

Imagine building an app with an AI assistant that, left alone, is brilliant but forgetful — it doesn't remember last week's decisions, and it doesn't automatically know all of Apple's rules.

**SwiftShip is a project manager + a team of Apple specialists that sits on top of Claude Code.** It gives you:

- **A clear path** — a sequence of simple commands (you type `/apple:something`) that take you from idea → design → build → test → ship.
- **A memory** — a hidden `.planning/` folder inside your project that records your spec, roadmap, decisions, and progress, so you can stop today and resume tomorrow exactly where you left off.
- **Specialists on call** — for the tricky parts (SwiftUI screens, in‑app purchases, iCloud sync, App Store review), the right "agent" is brought in automatically.

> **Important:** SwiftShip is *not* an app and *not* a program you compile. It's a set of carefully‑written instruction files (Markdown) that teach Claude Code how to behave like that project manager. There's nothing to build — you just install it and start typing commands.

### A simple mental model

Building an app is like building a house:

| House | SwiftShip |
|---|---|
| Blueprints & permits | the `.planning/` files (spec, roadmap, plan) |
| The foreman you give orders to | the `/apple:*` commands you type |
| The plumber, electrician, roofer | the specialist *agents* the foreman calls in |
| The building‑code manuals on the shelf | the **skills library** (a separate companion project) |

---

## Highlights

- **49 commands** covering the whole lifecycle: idea validation, planning, building, testing, App Store metadata, screenshots, TestFlight, submission, and post‑launch.
- **Works for brand‑new apps *and* existing apps** — one command maps your existing code, and another turns it into a phased feature‑plus‑bug‑fix release plan.
- **Run & screenshot your app** — quality commands can actually launch your app (iOS Simulator *or* a real Mac app) and look at it, instead of just asking you "does it work?"
- **Optional App Store Connect automation** — with the right tool connected, commands can *push* your metadata, release notes, and TestFlight setup straight to App Store Connect — always after showing you a preview and asking first. (The final "Submit for Review" always stays your decision.)
- **Data‑driven planning** — pull real downloads, sales, crashes, and reviews into your "what to build next" decisions.
- **Portable** — installs on any Mac with one script; no hardcoded paths to edit.
- **Graceful by default** — every "smart" capability is optional. If a tool isn't installed, the command quietly falls back to plain manual instructions. Nothing breaks.

```

**Optional tool handoffs:** where a supported tool is connected, some commands can *act* (push your metadata, screenshot the running app, read your sales) instead of only printing manual steps. These are always **opt‑in, preview‑first, and confirm‑before‑acting**, and they **degrade gracefully** — with nothing connected, every command simply gives you manual instructions. (Details in [Optional power‑ups](#optional-power-ups-tool-handoffs).)

## Installation

SwiftShip needs **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** and **Xcode + the Swift toolchain** on your Mac. The companion "manuals" library it reads from ([claude-code-apple-skills](https://github.com/rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills)) comes with either install path below.

### Install as a Plugin (recommended)

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills
/plugin install apple-skills@indie-apple-stack
/plugin install apple@indie-apple-stack
```

Then start a **fresh session** in your app project and run `/apple:help`. Update any time with `/plugin marketplace update indie-apple-stack`; remove with `/plugin uninstall apple`.

- **Install both plugins.** `apple` is the workflow; `apple-skills` is the knowledge library its commands read. A session-start hook wires the file paths between them automatically.
- **Why is it named `apple`, not `swiftship`?** A plugin's name is its command namespace — naming it `apple` is what keeps the commands spelled `/apple:build`, `/apple:plan`, … It appears as **SwiftShip** in the plugin browser.
- **The usage ledger is on by default for plugin installs.** The plugin registers SwiftShip's local-only usage hook (`~/.claude/swiftship-usage.jsonl` — timestamps, command names, and outcomes only; **nothing ever leaves your machine**). Turn it off with `/plugin disable apple`, or delete the file anytime. Manual installs remain strictly opt-in (see below).
- **Migrating from a manual install?** Run `./install.sh --uninstall` from your checkout first, so you don't end up with duplicate `/apple:*` commands. If you had opted into the usage hook, also remove its two entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` (the ones referencing `swiftship-usage-log.sh`) — the script they point at is gone, and the plugin registers its own copy, so leaving them causes a hook error on every prompt and would double-log.

### Manual install (contributors / development)

From zero, that's three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills.git
git clone https://github.com/rshankras/SwiftShip.git
cd SwiftShip && ./install.sh
```

Then start a **fresh Claude Code session** in your app project (commands and agents load at session start) and run `/apple:help`.

The installer figures out where your skills library lives, in this order — so it works on any machine with no edits:

```bash
./install.sh                                              # auto-detect ../claude-code-apple-skills
./install.sh /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills            # or pass it explicitly
SWIFTSHIP_SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/claude-code-apple-skills ./install.sh   # or via env var
```

It creates **home‑relative symlinks** in `~/.claude/` so the commands work in any project, on any user account:

| Symlink | Points to |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/commands/apple` | this repo's `commands/` (linked as `apple` so the `/apple:*` prefix is preserved) |
| `~/.claude/agents/<agent>.md` | this repo's `agents/*.md` — **per-file**, so agents of your own in `~/.claude/agents/` are untouched |
| `~/.claude/swiftship-templates` | this repo's `templates/` |
| `~/.claude/swiftship-skills` | the `skills/` folder of your `claude-code-apple-skills` checkout |
| `~/.claude/hooks/swiftship-usage-log.sh` | this repo's `hooks/` script (inert until you opt in — see below) |

Because everything is referenced via `~/...` paths (which expand per‑user), there are **no machine‑specific absolute paths to edit**. Re‑run `./install.sh` any time you move the skills library. (Installs made before per-file agent linking are migrated automatically on the next run.)

**Stable vs dev:** `main` is the development channel. For a stable install, check out the latest tag (`git checkout v1.0.0`) before running the installer — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [Releases](https://github.com/rshankras/SwiftShip/releases).

### Updating

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills && git pull
cd /path/to/SwiftShip && git pull && ./install.sh   # re-run is idempotent; picks up new agents/commands
```

Symlinks track the checkouts, so most updates need only the `git pull`s; re-running `install.sh` costs nothing and covers releases that add files. Restart Claude Code sessions to load the changes.

### Uninstall

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall
```

Removes only SwiftShip's symlinks. Your own agents, your `settings.json`, the usage ledger, and every project's `.planning/` files stay untouched.

### Optional: local usage log

SwiftShip can keep a **local‑only** record of which commands you run and how they went (`~/.claude/swiftship-usage.jsonl`) — useful for spotting where your workflow stalls and what each command actually costs. Workflow commands append a one‑line outcome on completion; for a complete record you can also register the bundled hook by adding **both** entries to the `"hooks"` section of `~/.claude/settings.json` (the installer never edits your settings):

```json
"UserPromptSubmit": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/swiftship-usage-log.sh"}]}],
"PostToolUse": [{"matcher": "Skill", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/swiftship-usage-log.sh"}]}]
```

(`UserPromptSubmit` catches commands **you type** that are expanded client‑side; `PostToolUse` catches commands invoked through the Skill tool — Claude invoking one itself, or harness versions that route typed commands through Skill. Each invocation matches exactly one entry, and the ledger records which as `via: "typed" | "skill"`.)

**Nothing ever leaves your machine** — no analytics service, no phone‑home; the ledger holds timestamps, command names, counts, the session model, and how each command was invoked (typed vs Skill‑routed) only. Delete the file (or skip the hook) any time.

Once there's data, run **`/apple:usage`** to see the report: which commands you run, how they ended, where runs stall, and whether each command ran on the model tier it should have.

### Optional: fewer permission prompts

So Claude Code doesn't ask permission for every read, you can pre‑allow common safe commands in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read",
      "Bash(ls:*)", "Bash(cat:*)", "Bash(find:*)", "Bash(grep:*)", "Bash(wc:*)",
      "Bash(git status:*)", "Bash(git log:*)", "Bash(git diff:*)", "Bash(git branch:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Or let Claude Code set this up for you automatically with the `/fewer-permission-prompts` skill.

## Quick start

```bash
# (run these as slash commands inside Claude Code, in your project folder)

/apple:validate "menu bar app for focus and hydration"   # is the idea worth it?
/apple:new-app HydrationBuddy                             # define the app
/apple:roadmap                                            # break it into phases
/apple:plan 1                                             # detail phase 1
/apple:build                                              # build phase 1
/apple:review                                             # quality gate
# ...repeat plan → build → review per phase...
/apple:testflight                                         # beta test
/apple:submit                                             # ship it
/apple:help                                               # see everything, any time
```

## Using SwiftShip on a **new app**

This is the main, end‑to‑end flow. Each step writes a file into `.planning/` so nothing is forgotten.

1. **Validate the idea — `/apple:validate "your idea"`**
   Claude researches market size, competitors, feature gaps, and revenue potential, and gives you a **GO / PIVOT / NO‑GO** recommendation. Saves you from building something nobody wants. → `.planning/VALIDATION.md`

2. **Define the app — `/apple:new-app MyApp`**
   A guided interview: platform (iOS/macOS/both), the problem you're solving, target users, core features, how it makes money, and which Apple frameworks you'll need. → `.planning/APP.md` (+ a project `CLAUDE.md`)

3. **Create the roadmap — `/apple:roadmap`**
   Turns your spec into **7 phases**: Foundation → Core Features → Polish & Platform Features → Monetization → Quality & Testing → Pre‑Release → Submission. → `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`

4. **(Optional) Set preferences — `/apple:discuss [phase]`**
   Before planning, Claude asks how *you* like to work: architecture (MVVM, etc.), navigation, error handling, testing depth. These choices are remembered and applied automatically when planning and building. → `.planning/PREFERENCES.md`

5. **(Optional) De‑risk a tricky API — `/apple:spike "topic"`**
   Apple ships new APIs every year, most gated by OS version and device. A *spike* is a quick throwaway experiment that answers "does this actually work on my minimum OS / on these devices?" **before** you commit it to a plan. → `.planning/spikes/...`

6. **Plan the phase — `/apple:plan 1`**
   Breaks a phase into concrete tasks, each tagged `auto` (Claude does it with a specialist), `generator` (uses a ready‑made code recipe), or `manual` (you do it, e.g. create the Xcode project). → `.planning/PLAN.md`

7. **Build the phase — `/apple:build`**
   Works through the task list: brings in the right specialist agent, writes the code, runs checks, commits after each task, and updates the project's memory. At the end it runs a quality gate automatically.

8. **Verify it works — `/apple:verify`**
   Confirms the features actually work (builds, tests, and — if a supported tool is connected — it can **launch and screenshot the running app** and look at it). → `.planning/VERIFICATION.md`

9. **Review quality — `/apple:review`**
   Runs **5 reviewers at once**: code quality, Apple Human Interface Guidelines, App Store rules, performance, and security. Then — because AI reviewers are eager to find problems — every serious finding is **cross‑examined** before you see it: independent verifier agents re‑read the actual code and must confirm the issue is real. Refuted claims go to an audit appendix, not your report. → `.planning/REVIEW.md`

10. **Repeat 6–9 for each phase.** Or, to move faster, **`/apple:autonomous`** runs plan → build → verify across *several* phases hands‑off, pausing only when it needs you (a manual task, a blocker, or a serious issue).

11. **Prepare the store listing**
    - **`/apple:metadata`** — app name, subtitle, keywords, description. → `.planning/ASO.md`
    - **`/apple:screenshots`** — plan and automate App Store screenshots.
    - **`/apple:release-notes`** — "What's New" text for every channel.

12. **Beta test — `/apple:testflight`**
    Prepares your TestFlight beta and tracks tester feedback. → `.planning/FEEDBACK.md`

13. **Submit — `/apple:submit`**
    A final pre‑submission checklist plus an automated rejection‑risk review. (The actual "Submit for Review" click stays yours.)

14. **Wrap up & iterate**
    - **`/apple:milestone`** — archive the finished version and tag it in git.
    - **`/apple:next-version`** — start planning the next release (and pull in real user data to decide what to build).

---

## Using SwiftShip on an **existing app**

Already have an app — maybe half‑built, inherited, or shipped years ago? SwiftShip meets you where you are. There are two ways in.

### Option A — Adopt the full workflow

1. **Map the codebase — `/apple:map`**
   Read‑only. Claude scans your project and writes a clear summary: architecture (SwiftUI vs UIKit, SwiftData vs Core Data, navigation style), the key files (views, models, services), dependencies, and tech debt (TODOs, force‑unwraps, missing tests, rough test coverage). → `.planning/CODEBASE.md`
   *(This only describes your code — it never changes it.)*

2. **Plan the release — `/apple:release "add Search, fix the settings crash"`**
   The existing‑app counterpart to `/apple:roadmap` (which assumes a greenfield v1.0). It **reads the `map` analysis** so it won't re‑plan code you already have, **detects your shipped version** from the project and proposes the next one, and scopes this update's **new features *and* bug fixes together** into one phased plan — Build → Fix → Harden → Ship, scaled to what you're actually shipping. → `.planning/RELEASE.md` + `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
   *(No prior SwiftShip history needed — this works on an app that has never touched SwiftShip.)*

3. **Build and ship — `/apple:plan` → `/apple:build` → … → `/apple:milestone`**
   The same `plan → build → verify → review` loop as a new app. Features become build tasks; **each bug becomes a tracked task with its own regression test** (instead of drifting off on its own); the flows next to your changes get re‑checked so you don't break what already worked; then release notes, TestFlight, and submit. Close it out with `/apple:milestone` to tag and archive.

> **Where the other commands fit:** want a full written spec too? Run `/apple:new-app` first (optional) to capture `APP.md`. And once you're shipping version after version *through* SwiftShip, `/apple:next-version` picks up where a milestone left off — pulling in deferred items, captured ideas, and real user data.

### Option B — Use individual commands à la carte

Most commands work standalone on any existing code — no roadmap required. Just run the one you need:

- **`/apple:bugfix "crash in settings"`** — fast lane for a bug you understand: locate, fix, add a regression test, commit.
- **`/apple:debug "..."`** — systematic investigation for a *mystery* bug, with state tracking.
- **`/apple:test [file | phase | "recent"]`** — generate tests for code you point it at (it matches your existing framework — Swift Testing or XCTest — and won't silently mangle your Xcode project).
- **`/apple:perf "slow scrolling"`** — profile and diagnose performance issues.
- **`/apple:security`** — full security audit (secrets, Keychain, network, privacy manifest). → `.planning/SECURITY.md`
- **`/apple:visual-qa`** — visual/UI audit from screenshots or by scanning your SwiftUI for anti‑patterns (and it can capture fresh screenshots for you).
- **`/apple:review`** — the 5‑reviewer quality sweep.
- **`/apple:spike "..."`** — try a new Apple API safely before adopting it.

> **Tip:** `map` is *analysis only* — it tells you the shape of your code; it doesn't refactor anything. Use the à‑la‑carte commands for actual changes.

---

## Optional power-ups (tool handoffs)

This is what's special about SwiftShip beyond planning: where a supported tool is connected to Claude Code, certain commands can **do the last mile for you** instead of just telling you to go do it. Every one of these is **opt‑in**, shows you a **before → after preview**, and **asks before acting** — and if the tool isn't connected, the command simply gives you the manual steps as before.

| Capability | What it does | Commands |
|---|---|---|
| **Run & screenshot your app** | Builds, launches, and screenshots the running app — iOS Simulator *or* a real macOS app (menu‑bar apps included) — and looks at the result. | `/apple:verify`, `/apple:visual-qa` |
| **Push to App Store Connect** | Pushes generated name / subtitle / keywords / description / promo text / "What's New" straight to your listing, each field previewed and confirmed — including per‑market translations. | `/apple:metadata`, `/apple:release-notes`, `/apple:localize` |
| **Manage TestFlight** | Lists/creates beta groups, adds testers (with a clear "this emails a real person" confirmation), and pulls crash feedback into your notes. | `/apple:testflight` |
| **Pre‑fill a submission** | Creates the App Store version record and pushes final metadata — then stops. `ship` also uploads media + build and drives the last mile (submission stays gated). | `/apple:submit`, `/apple:ship` |
| **Finalize IAPs & subscriptions & legal URLs** | Sets a one‑time IAP's price + localized name/description, creates subscription groups/tiers/offers, and publishes legal pages + sets the ASC Privacy/Support URLs — each write previewed and confirmed (dry‑run → apply), via your own ASC API key. | `/apple:iap`, `/apple:subscription`, `/apple:privacy` |
| **A/B test the product page** | Creates Product Page Optimization experiments (icon / screenshots / subtitle), reads the results, and promotes the confident winner. | `/apple:experiment` |
| **Run in‑app events** | Creates and localizes App Store in‑app event cards (challenges, seasonal moments) that surface in Search & Today. | `/apple:event` |
| **Data‑driven planning** | Pulls real downloads, sales, crashes, sessions, and low‑star reviews into your "what to build next" decisions and milestone summaries. | `/apple:next-version`, `/apple:milestone`, `/apple:learn-from-store` |

**Safety rules built in:**
- **Manual is always the default.** The "smart" path is offered, never forced.
- **Nothing outward‑facing happens without an explicit yes**, one action at a time (no silent batches).
- **Reversible by design where possible** — e.g. metadata stays editable until you submit.
- **The "Submit for Review" button is never automated.** It's reviewer‑facing and hard to undo, so it always stays a manual click in App Store Connect.
- **Least privilege.** Each command can only touch the specific tools it needs.

These rely on optional, *separately‑installed* tools (an App Store Connect connector, a "run in Simulator" helper, sales/health reporters). They are **not** required to use SwiftShip — they're bonuses that activate only when present.

## Specialized agents

For `auto` tasks, `/apple:build` brings in the right specialist. All default to a cost‑efficient model; two high‑stakes moments escalate a single worker to a stronger one — verifying a Critical review finding, and the 1–2 foundation tasks a plan marks as architecture‑critical:

| Agent | Expertise |
|---|---|
| `swiftui-builder` | Modern SwiftUI, `@Observable`, NavigationStack |
| `storekit-expert` | StoreKit 2, subscriptions, in‑app purchases |
| `cloudkit-expert` | iCloud sync, conflict resolution |
| `swift-generalist` | Everything else — data, navigation, networking, tests |
| `hig-reviewer` | Human Interface Guidelines (read‑only) |
| `app-store-reviewer` | App Store Review Guidelines (read‑only) |

## The skills library (companion project)

SwiftShip is the *manager*; the **[claude-code-apple-skills](https://github.com/rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills)** repo is the *knowledge* — 140+ reusable "skills" (Apple coding playbooks and code generators). When SwiftShip builds a paywall, a settings screen, or a privacy manifest, it's following a recipe from there. The two are designed as a pair. A few examples of what gets pulled in when:

| When… | Uses… |
|---|---|
| Validating an idea | `product/market-research`, `product/competitive-analysis` |
| Building SwiftUI views | `ios/coding-best-practices`, `macos/coding-best-practices` |
| Implementing a paywall | `generators/paywall-generator` |
| Adding a settings screen | `generators/settings-screen` |
| Apple Intelligence features | `apple-intelligence/foundation-models`, `…/app-intents`, `…/visual-intelligence` |
| Running a security audit | `security/`, `security/privacy-manifests` |
| Optimizing App Store keywords | `app-store/keyword-optimizer`, `app-store/app-description-writer` |
| Setting up CI/CD | `generators/ci-cd-setup`, `generators/error-monitoring` |

*(That's a tiny sample — the library spans 23 categories.)*

## FAQ

**Do I need to know how to code?**
It helps, but SwiftShip is designed so you can drive at a high level. You'll still want Xcode installed and an Apple Developer account to actually ship.

**Will it change my code without asking?**
Building (`/apple:build`, `/apple:bugfix`, `/apple:test`) writes code and commits — that's the point. Analysis commands (`/apple:map`, `/apple:review`, `/apple:security`) are read‑only. Anything that touches the *outside world* (App Store Connect, TestFlight emails) always previews and asks first, and is off unless you've connected the optional tool.

**Is anything sent to Apple automatically?**
Only if you opt in to a tool handoff and confirm it. The final **Submit for Review** is never automated.

**What if I don't install the optional tools?**
Everything still works — those commands just give you manual instructions instead. SwiftShip degrades gracefully.

**Can I use it on a project that's already on the App Store?**
Yes — start with `/apple:map`, or just use commands like `/apple:bugfix`, `/apple:test`, `/apple:perf`, and `/apple:metadata` à la carte.

## Philosophy

1. **Spec‑driven** — every app starts with a clear, written specification.
2. **Phased** — work in focused phases, not overwhelming scope.
3. **Specialized** — the right agent for each kind of task.
4. **Persistent** — planning files keep context across sessions.
5. **Apple‑first** — built specifically for iOS/macOS and Apple's guidelines.
6. **Safe by default** — manual fallback always works; outward actions are opt‑in and confirmed.
